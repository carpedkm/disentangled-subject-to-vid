    "description_0": "In the bustling city of Paris, the Mona Lisa is displayed against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower, capturing the essence of French culture. The photo is taken from the side, slightly elevated, giving a three-quarter view of the painting in a street-side exhibit. It's a sunny afternoon, with golden sunlight reflecting off the glass casing of the painting. In the background, tourists are casually strolling, some stopping to take photos of the iconic landmark while others admire the Mona Lisa's subtle smile beneath its protective case.",
    "description_1": "On a secluded sandy beach, the Mona Lisa is propped up on an easel under a simplistic summer canopy. The viewpoint is from the rear, allowing the viewer to see both the painting and the ocean stretching out to the horizon at sunset. Subtle twilight colors blend, casting a rosy glow over the scene. The beach is deserted except for the gentle waves lapping at the shore and a few seagulls swooping overhead, creating a peaceful, almost poetic ambiance. The frame of the Mona Lisa is weathered, adding to the rustic charm of this unconventional display.",
