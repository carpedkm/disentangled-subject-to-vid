    "description_0": "Within the cozy confines of a modern kitchen, the harmonica sits atop a marble countertop. The photograph is taken from a three-quarter view, capturing the harmonious blend of wood and metal. Dim, ambient evening light from under-cabinet fixtures creates soft shadows and a homely atmosphere. The out-of-focus background displays various kitchen utensils and a lit stovetop, hinting at a night filled with music and culinary delights.",
    "description_1": "In a professional studio setting, the Hohner Marine Band Harmonica is photographed against a plain white background, epitomizing a classic product image. The high-key lighting ensures even illumination across the object, eliminating all shadows and highlighting the craftsmanship of its design. Taken from a three-quarter view angle, the photo clearly showcases the engraved branding and symmetrical rows of holes. The harmonica's wooden comb and polished metal cover plates are captured with exceptional clarity, drawing attention to its elegant, timeless design.",
